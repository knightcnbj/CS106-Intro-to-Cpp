project storage for CS106B by Stanford 

For the record, I'm not a student at Stanford. And you should not use my code to submit your assignment if you are a student. I'm just doing this for fun.

CS106B is the second part of entry level CS course we take at any university

here we learn the basic of C++
from data structures to common features like pointers and memory management through a series of projects

all of the project handouts can be found at Stanford CS website of CS106B.

here's the link to my notes:
1. learn X in Y minutes (X == C++)
